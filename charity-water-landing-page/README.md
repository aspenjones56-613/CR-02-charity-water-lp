# Charity Water Landing Page

This project is a simple landing page for Charity Water, designed to inspire action and support for the cause. The page is built using basic HTML and CSS, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **images/placeholder.jpg**: A placeholder image that can be used in the landing page design. This will be replaced with actual images later.
  
- **styles/style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles for the landing page. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the page.
  
- **index.html**: The main HTML document for the landing page. It structures the content and links to the CSS styles.
